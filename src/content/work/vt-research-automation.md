Automation that accelerated faculty research.

**What I built**
- Parsers + metadata extraction with **BeautifulSoup**, **Pandas**.
- NLP classifiers (spaCy + scikit‑learn) → faster categorization.
- Summary reports & visuals (Matplotlib, Seaborn).

**Outcome**: ~85% efficiency gain; ~70% reduction in manual review time.

## Why this project
I wanted to solve a concrete problem and learn by building. This section explains the motivation and the end user value.

## Approach
Brief outline of the method, tradeoffs, and design choices.

## Architecture / Pipeline
A concise walkthrough of the components, data flow, and key libraries.

## Results & Impact
What worked, what improved, and evidence (metrics, examples, UX).

## What I'd do next
Clear next steps to make this more robust or production-ready.
