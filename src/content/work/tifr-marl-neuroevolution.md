Designed and executed multi‑agent reinforcement learning simulations.

**Impact**
- ~85% training efficiency improvement over baseline variants.
- Large‑scale experiment data across NoSQL (JSON) and SQL.

**Infra**
- Distributed preprocessing/analysis with **Hadoop + Spark**.

**Stack**: Python, PyTorch, NumPy, Hadoop, Spark

## Why this project
I wanted to solve a concrete problem and learn by building. This section explains the motivation and the end user value.

## Approach
Brief outline of the method, tradeoffs, and design choices.

## Architecture / Pipeline
A concise walkthrough of the components, data flow, and key libraries.

## Results & Impact
What worked, what improved, and evidence (metrics, examples, UX).

## What I'd do next
Clear next steps to make this more robust or production-ready.
